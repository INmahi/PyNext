PyNEXT Project




Project instructions


1. This project carries 50% weight in the PyNEXT course evaluation.

2. You must submit the project as a .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook).

3. You have to submit this project individually.

4. A demo of this project will be provided for better understanding.

5. You can use any dataset of your choice.

6. You may use multiple datasets, but they must be similar. Example: if you are working with House prices then you can use multiple house price dataset
7. You shall submit the project in Google Classroom




Demo project: House price regression 


Recommended Datasets: 


House price dataset
Titanic Dataset





Project deadline: 5th October,2025




Project overview:
  
1) Import a Dataset
You can choose any dataset you like (e.g., Titanic, Iris, Housing Prices, Health Dataset).
If unsure, seek suggestions from instructors or use one of the recommended datasets.
2) Import All the Necessary Libraries
3) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   * Understand the dataset using descriptive statistics .info(), .describe(), .shape(), .head(), etc.

   * Create visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, bar plots, etc.).

   * After each plot/graph/curve, write an explanation in a Markdown cell describing what you observed.

4) Check for Outliers
      * Use boxplots to check if there are any outliers in the columns.

      * If any outliers exist, remove them.

5) Handle Missing Values
         * Check for null values in the dataset and display them.

         * If any null values exist, fill them with appropriate values such as 0, mean, or median.

6) Feature Engineering (For extra marks )
            * Create new features from existing variables (e.g., BMI = weight / height²).

            * Drop unnecessary columns that do not add value (e.g., id, redundant text fields, etc.).

7) Key Insights & Findings
At the end of your notebook, write a structured summary of your main findings in Markdown.
Example Structure:
               * Data Overview (size, features, types)

               * Outlier Analysis (what was removed)

               * Missing Value Treatment

               * Important EDA Findings (patterns, distributions, correlations)

               * Feature Engineering Steps

               * Final Cleaned Dataset Ready for Modeling
Also write your personal opinion on the overall project experience


8) Any kind of creative preprocessing or data science operation, not mentioned in the instructions, will be appreciated.
